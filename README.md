# Drive-Upload
Script to send a user's home directory to Google Drive.

## Installation Notes
This script uses the [GAM](https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM) software to upload the files and to check for users. This software **must** be installed first and be working before this script will do anything. There is a variable at the top of the script of where it thinks it should be. Change this if it is wrong.
